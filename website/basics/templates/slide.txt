Hello world. Chai peelo. 


Front End
### We used flask framework to build a webapp.
### Sqlite database is used to store the data locally on the server. 
### We used flask because it provides simplicity, flexibility and fine-grained 	control.
### We used sqlite database becuase it emphasizes scalability, concurrency, centralization.




### Plotly.js library is used to plot the datapoints. 
### We plotted Graphs which include
	### Temperature VS Time
	### Humidity VS Time
	### Flow VS Time 
	### Efficiency vs Time 
	etc
### From the color of the status button, we can know the state of the system. 
	### Black means system is off. 
	### Green means attribute is working properly.
	### Yellow means attribute is in a state near breakdown. 
	### Red means attribute is in a breakdown state.
